# Lab06: Inheritance and Interfaces
## Architecture:
The architecture of this application was built using Gradle version 7.1.1 .

* In the src/main/java/inheritance package we have 3 classes:
1. Library (has the main method).
2. Restaurant.
3. Review
* In the src/test/java/inheritance package we have the test file:
* The testing file has the following testing methods:

1. constructorRestaurant: tests if the restaurant class' constructor is instantiating correctly.
2. toStringRestaurant: tests if the restaurant class' toString method is returning correctly.
3. constructorReview: tests if the review class' constructor is instantiating correctly.
4. toStringReview: tests if the review class' toString method is returning correctly.
5. testAddReviewMethod: tests if the adding reviews into a restaurant instance is working and returns the right String value.
